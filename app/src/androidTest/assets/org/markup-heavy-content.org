=PERIOD= is in the format of =OP.TIME=

=OP= can be:
- =eq= -- equal to =TIME=
- =ne= -- not equal to =TIME=
- =lt= -- less than =TIME=
- =le= -- less than or equal to =TIME=
- =gt= -- greater than =TIME=
- =ge= -- greater than or equal to =TIME=

If =OP= is not specified:
- Default value for =s= and =d= is =le=
- Default value for =c= is =eq=

=TIME= can be:
- =Nh= -- =N= hours from now
- =Nd= -- =N= days from now
- =Nw= -- =N= weeks from now
- =Nm= -- =N= months from now
- =Ny= -- =N= years from now

=N= can be negative.

For example:
- =-2h= -- two hours ago
- =5d= -- five days from today
- =-2w= -- two weeks ago
- =3m= -- three months from today
- =1y= -- one year from today

Few aliases for =TIME= are available:
- =tomorrow=, =tmrw= or =tom=
- =today= or =tod=
- =now=
- =yesterday=

=PERIOD= can be =none= or =no= which matches notes without the property.

=STATE= is a keyword like =TODO=, =DONE=, =NEW=, etc. Keywords are
case insensitive. Only states specified in Settings can be searched
by. Any keywords not included in the settings are not treated as
states - they become part of note's title.

=STATE-TYPE= can be =todo=, =done= or =none=.

=NOTEBOOK= is the name of notebook. It must be surrounded with double
quotes if it contains spaces.

=TAG= is searched as a substring. For example ~t.bee~ will find notes
which are tagged with =beeblebrox=.

=PRIORITY= is a priority starting from =A=.

Default ordering of notes is by notebook name then priority. If =s= or
=d= are used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or
deadline time. They are always sorted by position in the notebook
last.

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

Using =o.PROPERTY= will sort notes by property. =.o.PROPERTY= is also
supported which sorts notes by property in reverse order. You can
specify multiple operators and they will be used in order.

Following properties are supported:

|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Property                    | Order by                      |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| =b= =book= =notebook=       | Notebook name                 |
| =s= =sched= =scheduled=     | Scheduled time                |
| =c= =close= =closed=        | Closed time                   |
| =d= =dead= =deadline=       | Deadline time                 |
| =p= =pri= =prio= =priority= | Priority                      |
| =st= =state=                | States as defined in Settings |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|

You can add =ad.DAYS= to any query to display search results grouped by day.

=DAYS= is a number of days you want to display.

For example, ~(t.gym or t.class) ad.3~ will display notes tagged with
=gym= or =class= with any type of time set within next 3 days.

- ~i.todo t.john~ - Search for =TODO= notes which are tagged with =john=
- ~b.Work .i.done~ - Search in notebook =Work= for notes without =DONE= state
- ~(b.Home or b.Work) phone~ - Search in notebooks =Home= and =Work= for notes which contain the string =phone= in their title, content or any of the tags
- ~s.1d p.a~ - Search for priority =A= notes scheduled for tomorrow or earlier (same as ~p.a s.tom~)
- ~s.ge.today o.book o.pri~ - Search for notes scheduled for today or later, sorting them by notebook name then priority
- ~o.book o.pri o.s~ - Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time
- ~p.b~ - Search for notes with priority =B= (includes notes with no priority if default priority is =B=)
- ~ps.b~ - Search for notes with priority set to =B=

- =Nm= -- =N= months from now
- =Ny= -- =N= years from now

=N= can be negative.

For example:
- =-2h= -- two hours ago
- =5d= -- five days from today
- =-2w= -- two weeks ago
- =3m= -- three months from today
- =1y= -- one year from today

Few aliases for =TIME= are available:
- =tomorrow=, =tmrw= or =tom=
- =today= or =tod=
- =now=
- =yesterday=

=PERIOD= can be =none= or =no= which matches notes without the property.

=STATE= is a keyword like =TODO=, =DONE=, =NEW=, etc. Keywords are
case insensitive. Only states specified in Settings can be searched
by. Any keywords not included in the settings are not treated as
states - they become part of note's title.

=STATE-TYPE= can be =todo=, =done= or =none=.

=NOTEBOOK= is the name of notebook. It must be surrounded with double
quotes if it contains spaces.

=TAG= is searched as a substring. For example ~t.bee~ will find notes
which are tagged with =beeblebrox=.

=PRIORITY= is a priority starting from =A=.

Default ordering of notes is by notebook name then priority. If =s= or
=d= are used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or
deadline time. They are always sorted by position in the notebook
last.

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

Using =o.PROPERTY= will sort notes by property. =.o.PROPERTY= is also
supported which sorts notes by property in reverse order. You can
specify multiple operators and they will be used in order.

Following properties are supported:

|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Property                    | Order by                      |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| =b= =book= =notebook=       | Notebook name                 |
| =s= =sched= =scheduled=     | Scheduled time                |
| =c= =close= =closed=        | Closed time                   |
| =d= =dead= =deadline=       | Deadline time                 |
| =p= =pri= =prio= =priority= | Priority                      |
| =st= =state=                | States as defined in Settings |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|

You can add =ad.DAYS= to any query to display search results grouped by day.

=DAYS= is a number of days you want to display.

For example, ~(t.gym or t.class) ad.3~ will display notes tagged with
=gym= or =class= with any type of time set within next 3 days.

- ~i.todo t.john~ - Search for =TODO= notes which are tagged with =john=
- ~b.Work .i.done~ - Search in notebook =Work= for notes without =DONE= state
- ~(b.Home or b.Work) phone~ - Search in notebooks =Home= and =Work= for notes which contain the string =phone= in their title, content or any of the tags
- ~s.1d p.a~ - Search for priority =A= notes scheduled for tomorrow or earlier (same as ~p.a s.tom~)
- ~s.ge.today o.book o.pri~ - Search for notes scheduled for today or later, sorting them by notebook name then priority
- ~o.book o.pri o.s~ - Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time
- ~p.b~ - Search for notes with priority =B= (includes notes with no priority if default priority is =B=)
- ~ps.b~ - Search for notes with priority set to =B=

You can add =ad.DAYS= to any query to display search results grouped by day.

=DAYS= is a number of days you want to display.

For example, ~(t.gym or t.class) ad.3~ will display notes tagged with
=gym= or =class= with any type of time set within next 3 days.

- ~i.todo t.john~ - Search for =TODO= notes which are tagged with =john=
- ~b.Work .i.done~ - Search in notebook =Work= for notes without =DONE= state
- ~(b.Home or b.Work) phone~ - Search in notebooks =Home= and =Work= for notes which contain the string =phone= in their title, content or any of the tags
- ~s.1d p.a~ - Search for priority =A= notes scheduled for tomorrow or earlier (same as ~p.a s.tom~)
- ~s.ge.today o.book o.pri~ - Search for notes scheduled for today or later, sorting them by notebook name then priority
- ~o.book o.pri o.s~ - Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time
- ~p.b~ - Search for notes with priority =B= (includes notes with no priority if default priority is =B=)
- ~ps.b~ - Search for notes with priority set to =B=

=PERIOD= is in the format of =OP.TIME=

=OP= can be:
- =eq= -- equal to =TIME=
- =ne= -- not equal to =TIME=
- =lt= -- less than =TIME=
- =le= -- less than or equal to =TIME=
- =gt= -- greater than =TIME=
- =ge= -- greater than or equal to =TIME=

If =OP= is not specified:
- Default value for =s= and =d= is =le=
- Default value for =c= is =eq=

=TIME= can be:
- =Nh= -- =N= hours from now
- =Nd= -- =N= days from now
- =Nw= -- =N= weeks from now
- =Nm= -- =N= months from now
- =Ny= -- =N= years from now

=N= can be negative.

For example:
- =-2h= -- two hours ago
- =5d= -- five days from today
- =-2w= -- two weeks ago
- =3m= -- three months from today
- =1y= -- one year from today

Few aliases for =TIME= are available:
- =tomorrow=, =tmrw= or =tom=
- =today= or =tod=
- =now=
- =yesterday=

=PERIOD= can be =none= or =no= which matches notes without the property.

=STATE= is a keyword like =TODO=, =DONE=, =NEW=, etc. Keywords are
case insensitive. Only states specified in Settings can be searched
by. Any keywords not included in the settings are not treated as
states - they become part of note's title.

=STATE-TYPE= can be =todo=, =done= or =none=.

=NOTEBOOK= is the name of notebook. It must be surrounded with double
quotes if it contains spaces.

=TAG= is searched as a substring. For example ~t.bee~ will find notes
which are tagged with =beeblebrox=.

=PRIORITY= is a priority starting from =A=.

Default ordering of notes is by notebook name then priority. If =s= or
=d= are used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or
deadline time. They are always sorted by position in the notebook
last.

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

Using =o.PROPERTY= will sort notes by property. =.o.PROPERTY= is also
supported which sorts notes by property in reverse order. You can
specify multiple operators and they will be used in order.

Following properties are supported:

|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Property                    | Order by                      |

Following search expressions are supported.

Most of them support ~.~ (NOT) operator (see the last column).

|-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+---|
| Expression      | Finds notes              | Example       | . |
|-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+---|

=PERIOD= is in the format of =OP.TIME=

=OP= can be:
- =eq= -- equal to =TIME=
- =ne= -- not equal to =TIME=
- =lt= -- less than =TIME=
- =le= -- less than or equal to =TIME=
- =gt= -- greater than =TIME=
- =ge= -- greater than or equal to =TIME=

If =OP= is not specified:
- Default value for =s= and =d= is =le=
- Default value for =c= is =eq=

=TIME= can be:
- =Nh= -- =N= hours from now
- =Nd= -- =N= days from now
- =Nw= -- =N= weeks from now
- =Nm= -- =N= months from now
- =Ny= -- =N= years from now

=N= can be negative.

For example:
- =-2h= -- two hours ago
- =5d= -- five days from today
- =-2w= -- two weeks ago
- =3m= -- three months from today
- =1y= -- one year from today

Few aliases for =TIME= are available:
- =tomorrow=, =tmrw= or =tom=
- =today= or =tod=
- =now=
- =yesterday=

=PERIOD= can be =none= or =no= which matches notes without the property.

=STATE= is a keyword like =TODO=, =DONE=, =NEW=, etc. Keywords are
case insensitive. Only states specified in Settings can be searched
by. Any keywords not included in the settings are not treated as
states - they become part of note's title.

=STATE-TYPE= can be =todo=, =done= or =none=.

=NOTEBOOK= is the name of notebook. It must be surrounded with double
quotes if it contains spaces.

=TAG= is searched as a substring. For example ~t.bee~ will find notes
which are tagged with =beeblebrox=.

=PRIORITY= is a priority starting from =A=.

Default ordering of notes is by notebook name then priority. If =s= or
=d= are used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or
deadline time. They are always sorted by position in the notebook
last.

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

Using =o.PROPERTY= will sort notes by property. =.o.PROPERTY= is also
supported which sorts notes by property in reverse order. You can
specify multiple operators and they will be used in order.

Following properties are supported:

|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Property                    | Order by                      |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| =b= =book= =notebook=       | Notebook name                 |
| =s= =sched= =scheduled=     | Scheduled time                |
| =c= =close= =closed=        | Closed time                   |
| =d= =dead= =deadline=       | Deadline time                 |
| =p= =pri= =prio= =priority= | Priority                      |
| =st= =state=                | States as defined in Settings |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|

You can add =ad.DAYS= to any query to display search results grouped by day.

=DAYS= is a number of days you want to display.

For example, ~(t.gym or t.class) ad.3~ will display notes tagged with
=gym= or =class= with any type of time set within next 3 days.

- ~i.todo t.john~ - Search for =TODO= notes which are tagged with =john=
- ~b.Work .i.done~ - Search in notebook =Work= for notes without =DONE= state
- ~(b.Home or b.Work) phone~ - Search in notebooks =Home= and =Work= for notes which contain the string =phone= in their title, content or any of the tags
- ~s.1d p.a~ - Search for priority =A= notes scheduled for tomorrow or earlier (same as ~p.a s.tom~)
- ~s.ge.today o.book o.pri~ - Search for notes scheduled for today or later, sorting them by notebook name then priority
- ~o.book o.pri o.s~ - Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time
- ~p.b~ - Search for notes with priority =B= (includes notes with no priority if default priority is =B=)
- ~ps.b~ - Search for notes with priority set to =B=

- =gt= -- greater than =TIME=
- =ge= -- greater than or equal to =TIME=

If =OP= is not specified:
- Default value for =s= and =d= is =le=
- Default value for =c= is =eq=

=TIME= can be:
- =Nh= -- =N= hours from now
- =Nd= -- =N= days from now
- =Nw= -- =N= weeks from now
- =Nm= -- =N= months from now
- =Ny= -- =N= years from now

=N= can be negative.

For example:
- =-2h= -- two hours ago
- =5d= -- five days from today
- =-2w= -- two weeks ago
- =3m= -- three months from today
- =1y= -- one year from today

Few aliases for =TIME= are available:
- =tomorrow=, =tmrw= or =tom=
- =today= or =tod=
- =now=
- =yesterday=

=PERIOD= can be =none= or =no= which matches notes without the property.

=STATE= is a keyword like =TODO=, =DONE=, =NEW=, etc. Keywords are
case insensitive. Only states specified in Settings can be searched
by. Any keywords not included in the settings are not treated as
states - they become part of note's title.

=STATE-TYPE= can be =todo=, =done= or =none=.

=NOTEBOOK= is the name of notebook. It must be surrounded with double
quotes if it contains spaces.

=TAG= is searched as a substring. For example ~t.bee~ will find notes
which are tagged with =beeblebrox=.

=PRIORITY= is a priority starting from =A=.

Default ordering of notes is by notebook name then priority. If =s= or
=d= are used in the query, they are also sorted by scheduled or
deadline time. They are always sorted by position in the notebook
last.

You can change this behavior by using =o= operator.

Using =o.PROPERTY= will sort notes by property. =.o.PROPERTY= is also
supported which sorts notes by property in reverse order. You can
specify multiple operators and they will be used in order.

Following properties are supported:

|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Property                    | Order by                      |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| =b= =book= =notebook=       | Notebook name                 |
| =s= =sched= =scheduled=     | Scheduled time                |
| =c= =close= =closed=        | Closed time                   |
| =d= =dead= =deadline=       | Deadline time                 |
| =p= =pri= =prio= =priority= | Priority                      |
| =st= =state=                | States as defined in Settings |
|-----------------------------+-------------------------------|

You can add =ad.DAYS= to any query to display search results grouped by day.

=DAYS= is a number of days you want to display.

For example, ~(t.gym or t.class) ad.3~ will display notes tagged with
=gym= or =class= with any type of time set within next 3 days.

- ~i.todo t.john~ - Search for =TODO= notes which are tagged with =john=
- ~b.Work .i.done~ - Search in notebook =Work= for notes without =DONE= state
- ~(b.Home or b.Work) phone~ - Search in notebooks =Home= and =Work= for notes which contain the string =phone= in their title, content or any of the tags
- ~s.1d p.a~ - Search for priority =A= notes scheduled for tomorrow or earlier (same as ~p.a s.tom~)
- ~s.ge.today o.book o.pri~ - Search for notes scheduled for today or later, sorting them by notebook name then priority
- ~o.book o.pri o.s~ - Sort by notebook name then priority then scheduled time
- ~p.b~ - Search for notes with priority =B= (includes notes with no priority if default priority is =B=)
- ~ps.b~ - Search for notes with priority set to =B=
